      <h2><span class="date">11/22/2019</span>November updates!</h2>

      <p>It's a new month, which means it's time for some updates! This time around, we're focusing on Dump Destinations, Route Optimization and special feature that everyone's been waiting on.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>For Dump Destinations, you can still out-right <em>delete</em> a Dump Destination and Holding Yard, but we're now having those follow the same pattern we've established with Drivers, Trucks and more: the ability to <strong>deactivate</strong>!</p>
        <p>The great benefit to this is that now you can take a Dump Destination or Holding Yard out of service, but then return it back to working order, if necessary. Now, bear in mind, if you do deactivate one of those, you will need to ensure that there are no pending Job Requests that are pointing to them. Once you're certain you're absolutely done with one, you can go ahead and deactivate it.</p></li>
        <li><p>We also heeded the requests of our wonderful providers when it comes to Route Optimization! Before, if there was a Route Stop with an issue (keeping you from properly dispatching that route), it wasn't always obvious what was causing the issue. Well, no more! Now, CRO will let you know if any of our Route Stops with problem (e.g. invalid Latitude or Longitudes) so you can fix them and get your Routes dispatched, right away.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, this next announcement is an exciting one! There's a feature that's been on the tips of the tongues of so many of our providers, and we are very proud to reveal what we've been working on: <strong>Proration</strong>!</p>
        <p>Previously, if you wanted to prorate a customer's invoice, you would need to manually adjust it for each invoice with a proration. Well, not anymore! Now it's state-of-the-art and built right into CRO Billing.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to see if our proration feature is for you, please give us a call <strong>(844-276-2467)</strong> and we can walk you through how to utilize it. We can't wait to show this off!</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>As always keep your eyes on CRO Updates! You never know what goodies you'll find in here.</p>
