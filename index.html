          <li>Asset Descriptions now show on line item descriptions.</li>

      <h2><span class="date">2/26/2020</span>Attention: Quickbooks Desktop users!</h2>
        <p>We recently updated our code for the QuickBooks Web Connector that now allows you to set the "Default Delivery Method" (Email or Print) on a customer in CRO, and when you send an invoice over to your QuickBooks it will now transfer that setting over.</p>
        <p>NOTE: This will not retroactively set your customers to either Email or Print, but any that you set from now on will reflect that both in CRO and QuickBooks. If you do not change this setting, then it will still behave in QuickBooks as it has previously.</p>
        <p>Please don't hesitate to reach out to our Support Staff if you have any questions at <strong>1-844-276-2467</strong>.</p>

      <h2><span class="date">12/19/2019</span>Announcing PRORATION!</h2>
        <p>This announcement is an exciting one! There's a feature that's been on the tips of the tongues of so many of our providers, and we are very proud to reveal what we've been working on: <strong>Proration</strong>!</p>

        <p>If you'd like to see if our proration feature is for you, please give us a call <strong>(844-276-2467)</strong> and we can walk you through how to utilize it. We can't wait to show this off!</p></li>
