      <h2><span class="date">6/23/2022</span>NEW ROUTE FINDER</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in a previous "bell icon" post, the Route Finder process has recently changed. Assets can no longer be routed until they're deployed, which greatly improves reliability with route stop positions.</p>
        <p>However, the process is a little different now. Fortunately, we have also introduced some tools to help make this process as seamless as possible! To see our step-by-step guide on how to put new deliveries on routes, please refer to our training portal article, <a href="https://crosoftware.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7127431744909" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

      <h2><span class="date">02/02/2023</span>Presenting our new FOG report!</h2>
        <p>We have just released our new FOG (Fats, Oils and Grease) tracking and FOG report for those of our providers that service grease traps. If your company does not service grease traps then this new feature will not apply to you.</p>
        <p>However, if you do service grease traps you can activate our FOG features by going to your Settings and turning on "Enable FOG Report". This will then activate the FOG report as well as a new FOG pop up screen when you service grease traps. When you do, you or your drivers will see an option to enter the total fat, oil and grease in the trap.</p>
        <p>Please contact CRO Support with any questions involving our new FOG report update at <strong>1-844-276-2467</strong>.</p>

      <h2><span class="date">11/14/2022</span>Customer Portal updates.</h2>
        <p>For those of our providers that have already been using it, it's not news that CRO offers a <strong>Customer Portal</strong>. For all of our providers we've updated our Customer Portal to allow your customers to request a services, swap or pickup of their deployed assets. Your customers can now also pay any outstanding invoices that have been posted in CRO Billing with Card Connect integration!</p>
        <p>New Customer Portal requests also will now show up at the top right, next to the bell icon, from any page of CRO so you don't miss the requests. The first phase of our Customer Portal update will include a sign up process for your customers (for added security) and upcoming phases will offer additional features, so keep an eye on this space for future updates!</p>
        <p>We've also created a short walkthrough of how to operate the Customer Portal and sign up your customers. You can find the video, here:</p>

          <li>Asset Descriptions now show on line item descriptions.</li>
          <li>A new, "Service Date" field has been added to line items. This merely takes the service date from the Description and puts it into its own field.</ol>

      <h2><span class="date">2/26/2020</span>Attention: Quickbooks Desktop users!</h2>
        <p>We recently updated our code for the QuickBooks Web Connector that now allows you to set the "Default Delivery Method" (Email or Print) on a customer in CRO, and when you send an invoice over to your QuickBooks it will now transfer that setting over.</p>
        <p>NOTE: This will not retroactively set your customers to either Email or Print, but any that you set from now on will reflect that both in CRO and QuickBooks. If you do not change this setting, then it will still behave in QuickBooks as it has previously.</p>
        <p>Please don't hesitate to reach out to our Support Staff if you have any questions at <strong>1-844-276-2467</strong>.</p>

        <p>This announcement is an exciting one! There's a feature that's been on the tips of the tongues of so many of our providers, and we are very proud to reveal what we've been working on: <strong>Proration</strong>!</p>

        <p>If you'd like to see if our proration feature is for you, please give us a call <strong>(844-276-2467)</strong> and we can walk you through how to utilize it. We can't wait to show this off!</p></li>
