            <ul>
                <li>Create a new drop-off request and select the Recur options

            <p><strong>Why did we make this change?</strong></p>
            <p>Many providers expressed the need to tell their customers what route an asset will be placed on when
                taking a drop-off request order.

            <h2 id="-billing-updates-"><span class="date">08/10/2024</span><strong>Unbilled Jobs Tab</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>What&#39;s Changed</strong></p>
            <p>Certain conditions can make jobs unbillable, and an invoice cannot be generated. We have added an
                enhancement that shows the reasons for jobs being unbillable and a new &quot;Unbilled&quot; tab on the
                &quot;Invoices Page&quot; where you can collect these jobs and work toward making them billable, if
                necessary.
                <br />
                <br />
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>New Unbilled Tab<br> <img

                        style="width:635px;" /></li>
                <li>Jobs that cannot generate an invoice will allow you to move to the Unbilled tab or leave them where
                    they are.<br> <img src="https://cdn.crob.in/changelists/8-9-2024/Unbilled-tab/unbilled-image-2.png"
                        alt="drawing" style="width:400px;" /></li>
                <li>Merging invoices will show unbillable jobs<br> <img
                        src="https://cdn.crob.in/changelists/8-9-2024/Unbilled-tab/unbilled-image-3.png" alt="drawing"
                        style="width:530px;" /></li>
                <li>Unbillable jobs can be moved to the new Unbilled tab<br> <img
                        src="https://cdn.crob.in/changelists/8-9-2024/Unbilled-tab/unbilled-image-4.png" alt="drawing"
                        style="width:530px;" /></li>

            </video>

            <p><strong>Why did we make this change?</strong></p>
            <p>You&#39;ll now have more visibility into which jobs are excluded from invoicing and why, ensuring easier
                ways to fix discrepancies and keep track of your billing.</p>

            <h2><span class="date">05/01/2024</span>Design update to CRO.</h2>
            <p>We have pushed out a small update that refines some design elements of CRO. Things should look a lot
                cleaner, now!</p>
            <p>There is a chance that some of our providers will need to do an Empty Cache and Hard Reload in order for
                the changes to take full effect. If you notice anything amiss in the design of the software, you will
                most likely need to perform this quick procedure.</p>
            <p>To do the Empty Cache and Hard Reload, simply right click anywhere within CRO and then click "Inspect" on
                the menu that pops up. After that, RIGHT click on the refresh button of your browser and choose "Empty
                Cache and Hard Reload". After you click that you can then close the window that opened on the right side
                of your screen.</p>
            <p>This will FULLY refresh CRO and make sure that all updates are fully implemented. Your CRO should be
                better than ever now!</p>

            <h2><span class="date">02/23/2024</span>Customer Portal overhaul.</h2>
            <p>Our Customer Portal has been utilized by our providers for many years, now, and in the pursuit of making
                it as versatile, user-friendly and efficient as possible we've updated it again!</p>
            <p>Instead of having a separate portal for your assets as you do with your payments and invoices it is now
                unified into one, single portal requiring a single login. We've made some major improvements on the
                asset management side of things and we're just getting started!</p>
            <p>If you are interested in starting to use the Customer Portal and see all our newest updates, please reach
                out to our Support team at any time. We'll make it happen!</p>

            <h2><span class="date">10/10/2023</span>iPhone/iPad Driver's App Update</h2>
            <p>We are very pleased to announce that our fine developers have successfully pushed out a new update to the
                Apple App Store.</p>
            <p>This update specifically focuses on two things, with a few bug fixes in the background:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>GPS Tracking: GPS Tracking is now fully functional on the iOS app.</li>
                <li>Image uploads and bar code scanning: These functions now work just as they do on the Android app.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your drivers, who use the iOS version of the app, will need to go to the App Store and update the CRO for
                Driver's app. The update will only take a moment and as soon as it's finished you'll have access to
                these features. The app, itself, will look much as it did before but with new functionality in the
                background.</p>

      <h2><span class="date">10/3/2023</span>CRO Legacy Drivers app update</h2>
        <p>Our Driver's app has updated!</p>
        <p>With this update there are a few bug fixes and small updates in the background, but we also have two new announcements to make:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Barcode Scanning: The barcode scanning feature in the Driver's app has been updated to be more accurate, as well as offering support for QR Codes.</li>
          <li>The image upload issue for newer versions of Android has been resolved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We've found that the app is not auto-updating with these newer features, so your drivers will need to go to their Google Play store, search for "CRO Legacy Driver" and tap on the "Update" button. It only takes a minute and after the update the new features will be live for your drivers!</p>

      <h2><span class="date">5/29/2020</span>Small update to CRO Billing</h2>
        <p>There have been a couple of new additions to CRO Billing, making it even better than before.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Asset Descriptions now show on line item descriptions.</li>
          <li>A new, "Service Date" field has been added to line items. This merely takes the service date from the Description and puts it into its own field.</ol>

      <h2><span class="date">2/26/2020</span>Attention: Quickbooks Desktop users!</h2>
        <p>We recently updated our code for the QuickBooks Web Connector that now allows you to set the "Default Delivery Method" (Email or Print) on a customer in CRO, and when you send an invoice over to your QuickBooks it will now transfer that setting over.</p>
        <p>NOTE: This will not retroactively set your customers to either Email or Print, but any that you set from now on will reflect that both in CRO and QuickBooks. If you do not change this setting, then it will still behave in QuickBooks as it has previously.</p>
        <p>Please don't hesitate to reach out to our Support Staff if you have any questions at <strong>1-844-276-2467</strong>.</p>

      <h2><span class="date">12/19/2019</span>Announcing PRORATION!</h2>
        <p>This announcement is an exciting one! There's a feature that's been on the tips of the tongues of so many of our providers, and we are very proud to reveal what we've been working on: <strong>Proration</strong>!</p>
        <p>Previously, if you wanted to prorate a customer's invoice, you would need to manually adjust it for each invoice with a proration. Well, not anymore! Now it's state-of-the-art and built right into CRO Billing.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to see if our proration feature is for you, please give us a call <strong>(844-276-2467)</strong> and we can walk you through how to utilize it. We can't wait to show this off!</p></li>
        <p>For more information, you can also see our "Read More" link, below.</p>
      <p>As always keep your eyes on CRO Updates! You never know what goodies you'll find in here.</p>
